Our project aims to solve the problems that busy fish owners face when caring for their pets. While fish make excellent pets and require less hands-on work to care for than many others, they are still very sensitive to poor living conditions. Fish need to be fed regularly and have a clean tank set to the right temperature. For busy people on the go, providing such regular care can be quite a burden. Our solution combines a connected fish tank device and a companion application which will allow fish owners to care for their pets remotely and efficiently.
